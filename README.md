# Fake-News-Detection
This Fake News Detection system loads and labels real and fake news, cleans and vectorizes text using TF-IDF, trains four ML models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest), evaluates them, and provides a manual testing function to predict if custom news is fake or real.
